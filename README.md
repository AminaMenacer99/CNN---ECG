 Project Title: Cardiac Arrhythmia Detection using Deep Learning

Overview:
I have analyzed a subset of over 100,000 ECG signals to detect and classify cardiac irregularities using various machine learning and deep learning models such as CNNs.
The project aimed to showcase the capabilities of these models in identifying heart anomalies. 
Please note that the results and performance metrics presented here are based on the analysis of a subset of the dataset, not the entire collection.

Key Highlights:
- Utilized deep learning techniques for cardiac anomaly detection.
- Employed CNNs to classify irregularities.
- Leveraged optimization tools to enhance performance, achieving up to 99% accuracy.

Note:
The analysis presented in this repository focuses on demonstrating the capabilities of machine learning models in cardiac arrhythmia detection.
It's important to emphasize that the results and accuracy figures reflect the performance achieved on a subset of the dataset used for demonstration purposes.
